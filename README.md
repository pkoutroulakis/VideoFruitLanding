# VideoFruitLanding
## Description

* Project created as part of the Welcomely project for VideoFruit LLC. 

## Project Instructions

1. Given a sketch file, I was to create a landing page that duplicated the sketch drawing.
 
2. Using PS illustrator, generate all of the sketch layers into .png format, so PS can be used to manipulate or duplicate any images for the site.

3. Since I only had 5 hours, I chose to use the tools I was already familiar with. Github,Photoshop,and Bootstrap and JavaScript were used instead of Docker, Go Buffalo, and BitBucket in order to make use of the time on the actual landing page rather than only learn the new framework.

4. The buttons did not have to have functionality.

5. A slider was added because the given sketch file had more than one background picture(multiple layers).
